Description: Native Python SSHv2 protocol library
 "Paramiko" is a combination of the Esperanto words for "paranoid" and
 "friend". It's a module for Python 2.7/3.4+ that implements the SSH2
 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote
 machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require
 hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. You
 may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced Telnet and rsh for secure
 access to remote shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to
 open arbitrary channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel
 (this is how SFTP works, for example).
